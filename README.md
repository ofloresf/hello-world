# hello-world
My first GitHub repository
Hi All,

I am doing my first Hello World in GitHub, hopefully this tool will allow me the learn and understand how versions and repositories work. It will allso allow me to share my work with the rest of the World.

I am getting into the Data Science world learning with Coursera and IBM, is been a beatiful journey so far. The way to learn doing is what I love to do.

Hope you enjoy it as I am doing it.
